# Planned Features

-   Have a configuration file called config.json in .config/templative/
    -   For all future flag features, the default can be set here
-   Add git & no-git flags
-   Support symlinks
    -   This should create a new symlink
-   Add flags symlink & resolvesymlink
    -   Symlink is default behaviour, creating a new symlink
        -   If inside the template, keep a relative symlink
        -   Else if outside the template, make it absolute
        -   If the file cannot be found, print non-breaking warning!
    -   resolvesymlink instead creates whatever is on the other end of the symlink
-   Pull git links as template
    -   Should still have the same overall git setup of a single commit!
        -   Probably means deleting the git folder and re-initialising
    -   Optional caching based on flag.
        -   Flagging means we need an update command
        -   We also want to be able to specify specific commits
-   Template list has headers of TEMPLATE and LOCATION, underlined
    -   These should be columns
-   Configure write instructions:
    -   Strict no overwrite (default): error if directory is not empty
    -   Write no overwrite: error on file overwrite, allow non-empty directory, commit to pre-existing git if available
    -   Write skip overwrite: same as above, but skips files that would overwrite not error
    -   Overwrite: Replace overwritten files with new ones
-   Check user.name and user.email are set, error if not
-   Yellow warning and `(no git)` if git not initialised in template
-   Yellow warning and `(update available)` if git initialised and template is not up to date
-   Yellow warning and `(empty template)` if directory empty except from git
-   Blue colour and `(single file)` for links pointing at single files
-   Blue colour and `(symlink)` for links pointing to a symlink
-   If `template list` and no templates, tell user how to add one
-   Forbid recursion
-   Templates can optionally run a pre-init and post-init command. These are configured in the config directory
